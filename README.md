# Brain Weight Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting brain weight using various biological and anthropometric features. The goal is to explore relationships between variables such as head size, gender, and age, and develop predictive models that can estimate brain weight with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes scripts for cleaning and preparing the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting the data for training and testing.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Key visualizations and statistical summaries are provided to understand relationships between input variables and brain weight.
  
- **Model Training**: Multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest, etc.) are applied, with comparisons of performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
  
- **Model Evaluation**: The project includes comprehensive evaluations of the models using validation techniques, error metrics, and model optimization.
  
- **Deployment**: Basic instructions for deploying the trained model using Flask or FastAPI to create a simple API for predictions are provided.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/someshsingh-7251/Brain-Weight-Prediction.git
   cd Brain-Weight-Prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
   
2. **Training**: Run the training script to train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Prediction**: After training, you can use the model to make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input "path_to_input_file"
   ```

4. **Deployment**: Optionally, deploy the model using:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
